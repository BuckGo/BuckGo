- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BuckGoï¼ŒBuck's father.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in exploring the world of programming with Buck and discovering the joy that programming tools and processes can bring. Itâ€™s an enjoyable journey, BuckBuckGoGoGo!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning some productivity tools in programming, and they are really cool! They feel like the magical staff of Gandalf the White, full of enchanting powers.
